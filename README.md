MC spigot plugin 

# Goal
Incorporate an ability system that 
1. expands on the current system
> Using XP as the resource for casting abilities over a custom resource like Mana/Ki/Essence. Use existing items that are already known to have "mystic" properties (Lapiz, Diamonds, Gold, etc.). 
2. follows general MC's design philosophy
> The player is not able to use abilities on their own. The current ability system demonstrates that players only have access to abilities through the use of an enchantent item. 

# TODO
* Different wands
* Particle system
